# KiT-Con-Man (Keeping-in-Touch-Contact-Manager)

A relationship management app for people who struggle to keep in touch with friends and family. Uses spaced repetition to remind you when to reach out, without being overwhelming.

## The Problem

You have people you genuinely care about but haven't talked to in months or years. You think "I should text them" but then overthink it: *Is it weird after so long? What do I even say? When should I follow up?*

## The Solution

KiT-Con-Man uses the same science behind language learning apps - spaced repetition - to maintain relationships. It suggests the optimal timing for reaching out, starting gentle and building toward meaningful reconnections.

## How It Works

**Phase 1: Breaking the Ice** (Days 1-14)
- Initial message → Follow-up → Deeper conversation

**Phase 2: Building Connection** (Days 21-90)
- Coffee meetup → Planned activity → Regular maintenance

Different interaction types (messages, calls, hangouts) affect the next reminder timing. Deeper connections naturally space out longer while lighter touches keep relationships warm.

## Key Features

- Smart timing reminders based on relationship stage
- Daily limits to prevent overwhelming yourself
- Conversation starter suggestions
- Progress tracking for relationship strength
- Export your data anytime
